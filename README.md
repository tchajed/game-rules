# Board Game Rules

For our MIT CSAIL board games night, we play a lot of games. Often we want new players to play those games. We then proceed to explain the rules. Sometimes we don't do that so well. Here we attempt to do a better job of teaching people games.

Currently, the explanations we have are intended to be quick, ideally one-page, concise summaries that explain games in a logical order for newcomers. They aren't standalone; instructions for setup and facilitation are not explained, since we usually have someone available that knows the game to do these things (or we have to check the rules ourselves).
