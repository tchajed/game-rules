# Liar's Dice

Liar's dice is a poker-like game played with dice instead of cards. It includes bidding and bluffing.

## Goal

The game proceeds in rounds, where somebody loses a die after each round. The goal in liar's dice is to be the last remaining player with dice.

## Gameplay

Before each round, players roll their dice in secret. Players then take turns making claims on all the dice. Claims take the form of a quantity and a rank; for example, "7 \epsdice{2}s". Claims must **either increase the quantity or keep the same quantity and increase the rank**. For example, after "4 \epsdice{3}'s", "5 \epsdice{2}'s" is valid (increased quantity) and "4 \epsdice{5}'s" is valid (increased rank), but "4 \epsdice{2}'s" is not.

When someone makes a claim you don't believe, you can challenge it. The round then ends and **all dice are revealed**: if the claim was correct (there were at least that many dice of that rank), then the challenger loses a die. Otherwise the person making the claim loses one. Then the next round begins.

One additional twist: **\epsdice{1}'s** are wildcards; they count as any other number, **unless the first claim uses \epsdice{1}'s**.

## Strategy

The expected number of dice of some rank is however many you have plus the number of dice you do not control divided by 3 (due to \epsdice{1}'s being wildcards). When \epsdice{1}'s are not wildcards, divide by 6 instead.

Note that a \epsdice{6} forces the next player to increase the quantity.

You can target players by setting them up with claims that are on the _edge of reasonability_, so that they either call you and are wrong, or make a ridiculous claim.

Other than that, just bluff well.
