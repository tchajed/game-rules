# Deception: Murder in Hong Kong

Deception is a mostly-collaborative game of deception. One player is the forensic scientist (which is public), a hidden player is chosen as the murderer. All players except the forensic scientist get cards (to be explained). The murderer chooses what crime was committed (by picking cards in front of them) and reveals them to the forensic scientist. The forensic scientists' job is then to convey the murderer and chosen cards to the other players, who are investigators.

# Goal

The goal of the investigators is to guess the murderer's chosen cards, based on the clues given by the forensic scientist. The goal of the murderer is to not be guessed before everyone else has used their one guess. The forensic scientist wants to give clues that best help the investigators identify the murderer's cards.

# Gameplay

Everyone begins with four blue cards (murder means) and orange cards (murder hints) in front of them. The murderer must select a means and a hint from in front of themselves. The manner in which the hint plays into the murder is up to the interpretation of the forensic scientist and his fellow investigators.

The forensic scientist is given a purple "cause of death" hint card, several green location hint cards, and some random cards. They then place hint bullets on one of the choices for each card. They may play them in any order, and can only use one of the location cards. Obviously they shouldn't speak during this time, but the timing can be used to convey information.

During this time the investigators discuss what the clues indicate and may guess. Each player gets only one guess, and the forensic scientist responds with only "yes" (at which point the investigators win) or "no".

After the forensic scientist has placed all six bullets, they get a random hint card. They must replace an existing hint card (not the location or cause of death) with the new card and place a bullet on it. Then they do the same with one more card and no new information is revealed.

The game ends when an investigator guesses correctly or all players' hints are exhausted.

# Strategy

The forensic scientist often uses the cause of death card for the means card and the location for the hint, but this is not always a good idea. They want clues to be as distinguishing as possible between players. They can adjust the timing of giving clues in order to wait for the discussion to reach a good point; for example, refusing to give new clues when the current clues haven't been properly analyzed and when the new clue would just be more confusing.

As a murderer, you want it to be hard to distinguish between your cards and other people's: remember that the other possibilities must be for a means/hint from a single player.
