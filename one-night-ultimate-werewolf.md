# One Night Ultimate Werewolf

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a deduction and hidden role game. It is fast paced and features frequent lying. The game has a _night_ (setup) phase and a _day_ play phase.

## Setup

The setup is critical to the game. There are a bunch of roles, which are distributed randomly at the beginning, with 3 extra in the middle. You see your role at the beginning of the night. During the night, the announcer (an app) will go through several roles, who will do various things, including changing cards. It then becomes day, when play begins. You **play according to the role you have at dawn**. Yes, you don't know exactly what it is.

## End of night

At the end of the day, players **simultaneously vote** for someone to die. The player(s) with the highest number of votes die. If everyone has one vote, then nobody dies.

## Goal

The goal for the villager team is to kill at least one werewolf (even if one of them dies). The goal for the werewolves is that none of them die. The goal for the minion is for no werewolves to die (even if he dies). The goal for the tanner, independently from everyone else, is to die.

It is possible that there are no werewolves. In that case, the minion wins if he doesn't die and a villager dies. The tanner wins if he dies. The villagers _lose_ if they kill the tanner. They _win_ if they kill the minion; if there is no minion, they only win if nobody dies.

## Roles

Roles are listed here in the order they wake up at night (which is important). You pick some subset of the roles to use.

1. Doppelgänger: look at a player's card and assume that role, **including for win conditions**. Take the action **now for Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, or Drunk**; wake up with the appropriate role for the Werewolf and Mason. Doppelgänger-Minion gets her own phase at the beginning, and Doppelgänger-Insomniac gets her own phase at the very end. .
2. Werewolves: view each other. If there's only one, they can look at a center card.
3. Minion: sees who the werewolves are (they don't know him).
4. Masons: view each other.
5. Seer: (can choose to) view one player's card OR two center cards
6. Robber: (can choose to) exchange with someone, looks at new card
7. Troublemaker: (can choose to) exchange two other player's cards
8. Drunk: exchange with the center (doesn't see it)
9. Insomniac: views her own final card
10. Hunter: (doesn't wake up) if he dies, whomever he points to also dies
11. Villager: (doesn't wake up) no special powers

## Day

Say whatever you want. Don't show or look at your card. Vote when time's up (usually 5-10 minutes).
